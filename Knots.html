    <h1>1.Square Knot</h1>
    <img

    <p>
      The square knot is a classic for connecting lines and tying knots. Whether
      you are tying two ropes together to make a longer rope, or you are tying
      up a bundle of firewood to carry, the square knot is a winner. It’s much
      more secure and stable than its cousin the granny knot, which everyone is
      probably familiar with as part of tying their shoes.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Tie a Square Knot:</h2>
    <p class="img1-text">
      You can tie a solid square knot by lapping one rope right over left, then
      underneath the other, and then tying the same again in the reverse
      direction—left over right and then underneath. You’ll know you did it
      right when the working end and standing end of each rope is side by side
      (not making a “cross” like a granny knot).
    </p>
    <h1>2. Clove Hitch</h1>
    <img
      class="img2"
      src="images\J6TSQS6O46FI6EPW7S6CZ6MYK4.wdp.jxr"
      alt="Clove Hitch Knot"
    />
    <p>
      The Clove Hitch is an easy knot to tie, and it secures a line to a tree or
      post quickly, but it does slip when used alone, without any other knots as
      a backup.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Tie a Clove Hitch:</h2>
    <p class="img2-text">
      To create a Clove Hitch on a tree, make a loop of rope around the tree.
      Then make another loop and pass the free end of the rope under the second
      loop before tightening. To tie this one over a post or stake, just create
      a loop in the free end of the rope and slide it over the post. Then make
      another loop the same as the first. Put the second loop over the post
      (just above the first loop) and tighten the hitch.
    </p>
    <h1>3. The Bowline</h1>
    <img
      src="images\QLDJENGB5XFWNZSNSOKP2M276U.wdp.jxr"
      class="img3"
      alt="BowLine Knot "
    />
    <p>
      The bowline creates a loop at the end of a rope that cannot shrink or
      expand. This knot is often taught and illustrated with a poem of a rabbit
      coming out of the hole, hopping in front of a tree, going behind the tree,
      and back down his original hole.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Tie a Bowline:</h2>
    <p class="img3-text">
      Form a loop on top of the long end of the line. Pass the working end of
      the line up through the loop and around behind the line. Then pass the
      working end down through the original loop, all while maintaining the
      shape of the second loop you create, which becomes your bowline loop. Once
      the “rabbit” is back down its hole, pull the “tree” up to tighten the
      bowline.
    </p>
    <h1>4. The Figure Eight</h1>
    <img
      class="img4"
      src="images\NCMSHUCAVFEFEF5EBWXWH6NASU.wdp.jxr"
      alt="Figure Eight Knot"
    />
    <p>
      The figure eight knot creates a stopper wherever you need one on a rope,
      though the steps are also steps you take to create several other knots.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Tie the Figure Eight:</h2>
    <p class="img4-text">
      To tie a figure eight, also known as a Flemish bend, simply pass the free
      end of a line over itself to form a loop. Continue under and around the
      line, and finish the knot by passing the working end down through the
      original loop.
    </p>
    <h1>5. The Sheet Bend</h1>
    <img
      class="img5"
      src="images\BLV7GNHV335RI3AEZ3DWGZQJJA.wdp.jxr"
      alt="Sheet Bend Knot"
    />
    <p>
      The sheet bend is my favorite one of all, even though technically it’s a
      “bend”—a type of knot that connects one rope to another. I like it because
      it’s the best bend for tying different types of material together or
      joining different thicknesses of rope. This knot even joins together lines
      or materials that normally couldn’t be joined together because of
      differences in diameter.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Tie the Sheet Bend:</h2>
    <p class="img5-text">
      To create a sheet bend, bend the thicker or more slippery rope into a “J”
      shape (like a fish hook). Then pass the other rope through the hook shape
      from behind, wrap it around the entire fishhook once and then tuck the
      smaller line between itself and the other rope. If the ropes are the same
      diameter and texture, the sheet bend actually resembles a square knot. To
      tie a sheet bend with fabric or a tarp, collect, squeeze, and shape the
      material into a “J” shape, and then run your rope through and around the
      “J.”
    </p>
    <h1>6. Two Half Hitches</h1>
    <img
      class="img6"
      src="images\BNUS5MZOK4BNBJE6F2B5Z7EVDI.wdp.jxr"
      alt="Two Half Hitch Knot"
    />
    <p>
      You can use two half hitches to secure a line to trees or poles, or to
      secure the line to itself like you would tying a trucker’s hitch. A half
      hitch is fairly easy to tie, and I use it often to tie tarps up for
      shelters, or to hang up hammocks.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Tie Two Half Hitches:</h2>
    <p class="img6-text">
      After you wrap the rope around the standing end and through the inside of
      the loop created to make the first half hitch, wrap around the line the
      same way again to make the second half hitch. Pull it tight and you should
      have two half hitches, one seated next to the other. If you want added
      insurance, you can tie an overhand knot with the tag end of the line to
      keep the two half hitches from slipping.
    </p>
    <h1>7. Taut Line Hitch</h1>
    <img
      class="img7"
      src="images\UI3Q5U4PYNJ6NXIEUNOOH63NTA.wdp.jxr"
      alt="Taut Line Hitch"
    />
    <p>
      The taut line hitch takes the place of a slide to tighten or loosen a loop
      in a line (like a tent guy line). This knot grips well as long as there is
      tension on the “taut” side of the loop.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Tie a Taught Line Hitch Knot:</h2>
    <p class="img7-text">
      To tie the taut line hitch, create a loop by wrapping around a solid,
      unmoving object like a tree or tent stake. With the free end of the rope,
      wrap around the main line twice on the inside of the loop. Then lay the
      free end of the rope over the two wraps, wrap it around the main line, and
      draw the tag end through the loop you just created. Cinch the wraps until
      tight. Pull on the standing line and the taut line hitch should grip the
      loaded line.
    </p>
    <h1>8. Fisherman's Knot</h1>

      alt="Fiskermans Knot"
    />
    <p>
      True to its name, the Fisherman's Knot, is pretty much only good for using
      with fishing line.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Tie a Fisherman's Knot:</h2>
    <p class="img8-text">
      Pass the free end of the line through or around the object to be secured,
      for example, through the eye of a fishhook. Then, wrap the free end of the
      line around the other side of the line about five or six times. Pass the
      free end of the line through the triangular opening next to the object
      being secured, and then pass the free end of the line through the large
      loop you just created by going through the small triangle. If you are
      tying this one with fishing line, spit on the line before tightening to
      lubricate it so that the friction does not cause heat damage to the line.
      Tighten the knot, trim off any extra line and enjoy your day fishing.
    </p>
    <h1 class="">9. Water Knot</h1>

      alt="Water Knot"
    />
    <p>
      The water knot safely secures webbing, flat belts, and most types of
      straps together.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Tie a Water Knot:</h2>
    <p class="img9-text">
      To tie the water knot, start with a loose overhand knot in the end of one
      strap. Pass the other strap in the opposite direction so it mirrors the
      route of the overhand knot on the first strap. Take the ends of the two
      straps and pull the knot tight. That’s it—it’s very simple and very
      strong.
    </p>
    <h1>10. Rolling Hitch</h1>
    <img class="img10" src="images\untitled.png" alt="Rolling Hitch" />
    <p>
      The Rolling Hitch adds a leg to an existing line. This hitch is the basic
      knot behind a Taut Line Hitch, but it can be added to any existing line.
      The Rolling hitch was often used historically to hook more dogs to a dog
      sled main line.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Tie a Rolling Hitch:</h2>
    <p class="img10-text">
      Wrap the free end of one rope around the main rope to create a Half Hitch.
      Make a second Half Hitch and then wrap over the entire knot to finish with
      a final Half Hitch to the other side from your starting place.
    </p>
    <h1>11. Prusik Knot</h1>
    <img
      class="img11"
      src="images\NAXSOR4NTGNP24MPRNK2VOOJUQ.wdp.jxr"
      alt="Prusik Knot"
    />
    <p>
      The Prusik Knot creates a loop that can be used as an ascender or
      decender. This "slide and grip" knot can also be handy for adding a loop
      to a rope when neither end of the rope is free.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Tie a Prusik Knot</h2>
    <p class="img11-text">
      To tie a Prusik, you'll need a short rope and a separate long rope. Tie a
      loop in the short rope that is secured with a solid knot like a Square
      Knot. Now, wrap the loop around the long rope three times, making certain
      that each wrap lies flat against the long rope. Pass the loop of short
      rope under itself and pull it tight. As long as there is weight on the
      loop, the Prusik will grip the long rope. You can also slide the Prusik up
      or down the long rope by taking the weight off the loop and pushing the
      wraps up or down the long rope.
    </p>
    <h1>12. Timber Hitch</h1>
    <img

      alt="Timber Hitch"
    />
    <p>
      The timber hitch secures a rope to an object for hauling or to act as a
      support.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Tie a Timber Hitch:</h2>
    <p class="img12-text">
      To create a timber hitch, all you need to do is run the free end of the
      rope around the object, like a log, that you intend to pull. Then wrap the
      tag end of the rope around the inside of the loop you created four or five
      times. After you tighten the timber hitch so the four or five wraps are
      tight against the object, the constant tension will keep the hitch seated.
    </p>
    <h1>13. Blood Knot</h1>
    <img class="img13" src="images\NRTARVUY2R2DISNFIE5KAXKW7M.wdp.jxr" alt="" />
    <p>
      This little gem of a knot is used on fishing line to secure two lines
      together (mends a broken line or attaches leaders and tippets).
    </p>
    <h2>How to Tie a Blood Knot:</h2>
    <p class="img13-text">
      You'll start the Blood Knot by overlapping the two lines, and wrapping one
      free end around the other line five or six times. Pass the free end
      between the two lines. Wrap the other line the same number of times (five
      or six), and tuck the free end back between the two lines in the opposite
      direction of the other free end of the line. If using fishing line, spit
      on it to reduce friction damage.
    </p>
    <h1>14. Man Harness</h1>
    <img class="img14" src="images\ManHarness.wdp.jxr" alt="Man ManHarness" />
    <p>
      This crafty knot allows you to put a loop in a line anywhere along the
      length of a rope when neither end of the line is free to tie a loop—and
      you didn’t hear it from me, but a man harness is great for cheating at tug
      of war.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Tie a Man's Harness:</h2>
    <p class="img14-text">
      Gather some slack in the line and make a loop so part of the line runs
      through the middle of the loop. Grab the side of the loop and pull it
      through the gap between the line in the middle and the other side of the
      loop. Pull the new loop tight, and then pull the line to cinch the man
      harness knot. This knot can slip if there isn’t constant tension on the
      newly created loop, so keep something in the loop to hold it.

    <h1>15. Carrick Bend</h1>
    <img class="img15" src="images\CarrickBend.wdp.jxr" alt="Carrick Bend" />
    <p>
      This Square Knot alternate joins two ropes together securely, and is
      easier to untie than a Square Knot.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Tie a Carrick Bend:</h2>
    <p class="img15-text">
      To tie the Carrick Bend, form a loop with the free end of one rope. Pass
      the other rope's free end under the first loop, and then over then under
      as seen in the picture. Thread the free end across the loop passing under
      itself, and pull on both standing ends to tighten.

    <p>
      You don’t have to be a truck driver to have a use for this rugged hitch.
      The unique feature of the trucker’s hitch is it gives you a unique
      mechanical advantage for tightening up a line. While tying this hitch is a
      little complex, it’s worth the trouble if you need to tighten lines as
      much as possible before securing them—I use it all the time to tie down
      tarps or secure shifting payloads.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Tie a Trucker's Hitch:</h2>
    <p class="img16-text">
      Start off by tying a Figure 8 knot with a loop of the line. Then pass the
      free end of the line around or through whatever you're attaching the rope
      to, before passing the line through the loop. Next, pull the working end
      tight, and secure the free end with Two Half Hitches, just below the loop.

    <h1>17. Barrel Hitch</h1>
    <img class="img17" src="images\BarrelHitch.wdp.jxr" alt="Barrel Hitch" />
    <p>
      The Barrel Hitch has been used in sailing and construction work for
      centuries. It allows you to secure a bucket, barrel or other cylindrical
      object to lift it in a well-balanced position.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Tie a Barrel Hitch:</h2>
    <p class="img17-text">
      Place your barrel or other object to be lifted on top of your rope. Then
      tie an Overhand Knot across the top of the barrel. Open up the Overhand
      Knot until it wraps around the top sides of the barrel. Tie the ends of
      the rope together with a Square Knot and then then lift. This knot makes a
      fine bucket handle when the wire handle finally breaks off. SAFETY
      WARNING: For safety and stability while hoisting barrels, the rope around
      the barrel needs to be high above the center of gravity on the barrel, but
      pose no danger of slipping off the top of the barrel. FYI, beer has an
      excellent center of gravity.

    <h1>18. Sheepshank</h1>
    <img class="img18" src="images\Sheepshank.wdp.jxr" alt="Sheep Shank" />
    <p>
      This knot seems half magic trick, half practical knot, but it shortens a
      line without cutting the line. This knot keeps our long ropes in one
      piece, despite our miscalculations in the field. I will use this one on
      Bear bags, when the line is too long, but I don't want to cut it.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Tie a Sheepshank:</h2>
    <p class="img18-text">
      To tie a Sheepshank, fold the rope to the new length you need. Create a
      Half Hitch in one end of the continuing rope, and drop it over the nearby
      loop. Make a Half Hitch in the other standing end, drop it over its
      adjacent loop, and then tighten the whole thing slowly.

    <p>
      The tripod lashing is commonly used for shelters and to support camp
      items, like a cooking pot over a fire.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Tie a Tripod Lashing:</h2>
    <p class="img19-text">
      Start by collecting three poles that of almost identical length and
      thickness and lay them on the ground side-by-side. Tie a Clove Hitch to
      one of the end poles, and then wrap around all of the poles four, five, or
      six times. Now, wrap line between the poles–twice between each one–working
      back toward the original knot or hitch you tied. Finish the lashing by
      tying the tag end of the line to the tag end of your original knot. Spread
      the legs of the tripod and use it in your camp for something handy.

    </p>
    <h2>How to Tie a Square Lashing:</h2>
    <p class="img20-text">
      Tie a Clove Hitch to one of the poles, near the place where the two poles
      cross. Then wrap your line around the junction of the two poles, going
      under the lower pole and over the top pole. Spiral outward with these
      wraps five or six times. Next, wrap between the poles, biting onto the
      previous wrappings to tighten them. Finally, use a Square Knot to tie the
      free end of the rope to the free end from the Clove Hitch that started
      this whole lashing. Easy, right?
